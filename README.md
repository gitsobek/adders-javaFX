# 4-bit adder and 8-bit adder implementation

Both adders are built from scratch. From simple logic gates to digital combinational system. 

## Informations

Creation process:
1. NOT, AND, OR logic gates
2. Using above-mentioned logic gates XOR gate was created
3. Using one XOR gate and one AND gate a half-adder was created
4. Using two half-adders and one OR gate a full-adder was created
5. The program adds as many full-adders depending on how many inputs we enter.

In addition, this application generates residual code to check if the adder returns correct sum. 

## GUI
You can type input values to the adder via text boxes and if the adder generates correct results it prints out the sum, if not it prints error signal.
